Requires a .env file with the following
PORT = // Port to be used, should be an integer, defaults to 3000 if not provided
MONGO_URI = // URI for accessing mongo, local or atlas (with appropriate security)
SECRET = // Secret for cookie, should be a long, secure string
DEVMODE = // true/false, controls if full error messages are shown on the front end

After downloading or cloning the program, with a recent version of Node.js installed, you can start a localhost server by first doing ‘npm i’ in the terminal to install dependencies, followed by ‘npm run’ to launch it or ‘npm dev’ to launch it with automatic server restarts when changes are made.
